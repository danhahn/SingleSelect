# Single Select

There are many single selects out there but the all have flaws.

1. They look great on desktop but don't work well on mobile
2. The select item and the values often don't have the same length
3. When you get the bottom of the page the dropdown will often scroll off the page.

## What makes this one better?

You can use the same single select for desktop and mobile. You get the same select display but depending on the device you will get the styled dropdown or the native.

The selected item will always be the same length as the longest time.

When you get to the bottom of the page the dropdown changes to a drop up.

## Tech notes

Build using downshift and emotion styled components
